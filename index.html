Recent years have seen considerable advances in generative models, which learn distributions from data and also generate new data instances from the learned distribution; and dynamical models, which model systems with a dynamical or temporal component. Both of these developments have been leveraging advances in deep learning. The course will cover key advances in generative and dynamical models, including variational auto-encoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks, neural differential equations, physics guided machine learning, among other topics.
